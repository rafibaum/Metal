# Metal
Metal is a in-development robot framework for FRC, with a focus on making FRC programming more reliable and easy. The framework is being developed with a few key goals in mind:

* Clear structure for using the framework
* Well-written documentation
* Being easy to get started with while allowing for advanced functionality
* Being compatible with a wide array of hardware devices
* Being fully unit-tested
* Having a mock-backend so that you can test your code without a real robot
